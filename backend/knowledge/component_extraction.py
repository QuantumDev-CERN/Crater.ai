"""
LLM-based structured extraction: turns raw chunk text into Component /
ComponentRelationship / Procedure rows (plan.md §3-4).

This is intentionally a thin, single-purpose call — extract from ONE
chunk at a time, with the chunk id carried through as source_chunk_id
so every extracted fact stays traceable to its evidence (plan.md §8:
answers must expose "source document / page / section"). Batching
chunks together for efficiency is a reasonable later optimization, but
it makes provenance fuzzier, so it isn't the MVP default.

Extraction quality on tables/diagram-caption chunks will be weaker than
on prose text chunks — that's expected at this stage; treat low-yield
extractions as a retrieval-quality signal, not a bug to chase yet.
